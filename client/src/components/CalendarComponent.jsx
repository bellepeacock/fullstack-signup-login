// import Calendar from 'react-google-calendar-api';
// ask user to choose the month and year via dropdown—you don't need to get request the data as you're not looking into the future. 
// get the date from user, need to know which days are marked in red—this could be an array of dates that you pass as month, year.
// Render calendar with month and year—think about how to add new symptoms, will save in db somewhere.

// list days in array
// style array to look like a calendar, using tailwind most likely

// part of jsx so keep the calendar functions in here——

//  need to emulate this, but link to day and add symptoms in place of events https://demo.mobiscroll.com/react/eventcalendar/create-read-update-delete-CRUD

// Put the symptoms on the other side of  the pg (split into two) wheere it says what the date is
